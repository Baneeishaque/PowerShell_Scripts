#!pwsh
<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Creates a symbolic link to make the 'pwsh' command execute PowerShell Preview.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script finds the executable for PowerShell Preview ('pwsh-preview') and creates a
    symbolic link named 'pwsh' pointing to it in '/usr/local/bin'. This allows you to run
    'pwsh' in your terminal and have it launch the preview version by default.

    This is intended for non-Windows systems (macOS, Linux) where '/usr/local/bin' is
    a standard location for user-installed executables and is typically in the system's PATH.

    Administrator/sudo privileges are required to create a link in this directory.

.EXAMPLE
    sudo pwsh -File ./Register-PwshPreviewAlias.ps1
    Checks for pwsh-preview and attempts to create the symbolic link. You must run this with
    sudo for it to have the necessary permissions.

.NOTES
    - This script will overwrite any existing file or link at /usr/local/bin/pwsh.
    - This script is not intended for Windows.
