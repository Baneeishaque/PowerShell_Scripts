## Using Invoke-RestMethod
$webData = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://api.github.com/repos/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/latest"

## The release download information is stored in the "assets" section of the data
$assets = $webData.assets

## The pipeline is used to filter the assets object to find the release version we want
$asset = $assets | where-object { $_.name -match "win-x64" -and $_.name -match ".zip"}

## Download the latest version into the same directory we are running the script in
write-output "Downloading $($asset.name)"
Invoke-WebRequest $asset.browser_download_url -OutFile "$pwd\$($asset.name)"
